**Mera** is a Native Application built using the Kotlin programming language. This application was created with the aim of making it easier for victims of violence, especially women and children, to report incidents experienced by them.

## Problem

What are the problems that made us make this application?
 - Increasing cases of violence against women and children, especially during this pandemic. Many incidents go unreported due to several factors, such as embarrassment, perceived disgrace, etc.
 - The current system, generally still uses the telephone or comes directly to the office to report the incident.

## Solution

**MERA** is here to solve this problem. With this application, victims can report incidents just by filling out a report form. After that, the victim will receive feedback in the form of suggestions from the application regarding the incident experienced.

The system will automatically process the report and contact the relevant parties (police, hospital, psychologist, psychiatrist, etc.) to handle the case. The system will also categorize cases into severe or light. The categorization will help in the process of handling events.

 - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) Feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a _binding class_ for each XML layout file present in that module.
 - [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started) Adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
 - [CircleImageView ](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) A fast circular ImageView perfect for profile images.
 - [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) Fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
- [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.
- [Continuous Integration with Circle-CI](https://circleci.com/) Automate your development process with continuous integration in our cloud or on your own infrastructure.
